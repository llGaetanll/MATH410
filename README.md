# MATH410 Cheatsheet

This is my cheatsheet for MATH410 - Advanced Calculus. I took this class in the
Spring of 2023 with the amazing professor [Denny Gulick](https://www.math.umd.edu/~dgulick/).

The cheatsheet is provided as is. Some things are left unfinished, maybe I'll
get to them at some point, maybe I won't.
